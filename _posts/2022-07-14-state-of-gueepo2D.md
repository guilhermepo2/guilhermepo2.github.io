In case you are here by accident or some other reason, I am currently developing a simple 2D game engine in C++, you can find it on [github](https://github.com/guilhermepo2/gueepo2D) - even it's been enough time, maybe you can even make a game with it now!

Last month I embarked in a journey of rendering fonts on my 2D game engine, it was fun, it was a lot of work, but eventually I've made it. And then I didn't do any work on the engine for way more than a month.

In my defense, I moved to the other side of the United States, I have been working some overtime lately, and I've traveled to Brazil, the last 8 weeks or so were hectic.
