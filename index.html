                <p>Hey There! My name is <strong>Guilherme Oliveira</strong>, I'm some kind of a breed of a designer, artist and engineer. Passionate about game development and things that are somehow related to user experience.</p>
                <p>In my free time I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate at Federal University of Uberlandia, currently working for an educational group inside the university and researching on the subject of Information Visualisation on an Intelligent Tutoring System.</p>
                <p>I code at <a href="https://www.github.com/guilhermepo2" target="_blank">github</a>, write at <a href="https://medium.com/@guilhermepo2" target="_blank">medium</a> and sometimes <a href="https://www.twitter.com/guilhermepo2" target="_blank">tweet</a>. Currently writing on my <a href="https://gpolive.wordpress.com">blog</a> about my adventures on game development while trying to develop a game all by myself. Also you can reach me at <a href="mailto:guilherme.061@gmail.com">guilherme.061@gmail.com</a></p>
                <p>Hey! I know this is a terrible website but It's way better than the old one! Believe me! I'm working on improving it and making it more beautiful</p>

            <h1>Random Facts</h1>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>I like having hobbies that isn't related to computer science at all.</li>
              <li><strong>Photography: </strong>I can't practice it as much as I wished but it's cool, from time to time I mess with my DSLR, take some pictures, learn new stuff, cool.</li>
              <li><strong>Writing: </strong> I like writing, anything.</li>
              <li><strong>Yoga: </strong> This is the newest one, yoga and meditation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Totally Random Facts about me</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>#1 </strong>I like design a lot, so when I see something with a beautifully done design I just look at it and keep thinking about how they did it. For example, how they chose that color, that font, that font colors, those kind of stuff...</li>
              <li><strong>#2 </strong>I have a strange appreciation of certain kinds of images/wallpapers - I like it a lot when the theme is somehow related to being out of earth, for example, see Black Holes and Revelations art cover and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w">Cosmic Girls - Secret</a> Music Video. I also like depictions of modern architecture abandoned, any image that suggests some piece of architecture that was abandoned really. I also like post-apocalyptic related (see <a href="http://romanticallyapocalyptic.com">Romantically Apocalyptic</a> and their wallpapers) and minimalist aesthetic!</li>
              <li><strong>#3 </strong>I decided to start writing in 2010 or 2009 while I was watching The Pianist.</li>
              <li><strong>#4 </strong>Interstellar is my favourite movie forever and ever</li>
