          <p>Hey There! My name is Guilherme Oliveira, I'm some kind of a breed of a designer, an artist and an engineer. Passionate about game development and things that are somehow related to user experience.</p>
          <p>In my free time I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate at Federal University of Uberlandia, currently working for an educational group inside the university and researching on the subject of Information Visualization on an Intelligent Tutoring System.</p>
          <p>I code at github, write at medium and sometimes tweet. Currently writing on my blog about my adventures on game development while I try to develop a game all by myself.</p>
