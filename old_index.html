                <p>Hey There! My name is <strong>Guilherme Oliveira</strong>, I'm some kind of a breed of a designer, artist and engineer. I like game development and Game AI, also user experience, web and mobile development.</p>

                <p>In my free time I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate at Federal University of Uberlandia, currently working for an educational group inside the university and researching on the subject of Information Visualization on an Intelligent Tutoring System.</p>

                <p>I code at <a href="https://www.github.com/guilhermepo2" target="_blank">github</a>, write at <a href="https://medium.com/@guilhermepo2" target="_blank">medium</a> and sometimes <a href="https://www.twitter.com/guilhermepo2" target="_blank">tweet</a>. Currently writing on my <a href="https://gpolive.wordpress.com">blog</a> about my adventures on game development while trying to develop a game all by myself. Also you can reach me at <a href="mailto:guilherme.061@gmail.com">guilherme.061@gmail.com</a></p>

                <p>Hey! I know this is a terrible website but It's way better than the old one! Believe me! I'm working on improving it and making it more beautiful</p>

            <ul>
              <li>I like having hobbies that isn't related to computer science at all. For the moment, although not practicing all of them as much as I wish, these are my hobbies: <strong>Photography</strong>, <strong>Writing</strong> and <strong>Yoga</strong></li>

            <h3>Totally Random Facts about me</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>#1 </strong>I like design a lot, so when I see something with a beautifully done design I just look at it and keep thinking about how they did it. For example, how they chose that color, that font, that font colors, those kind of stuff...</li>
              <li><strong>#2 </strong> For some reason I like cosmic and post-apocalyptic aesthetic. I'm also a fan of minimalistic aesthetic, but this one is ok, I guess.</li>
              <li><strong>#3 </strong>Interstellar is my favourite movie forever and ever</li>
